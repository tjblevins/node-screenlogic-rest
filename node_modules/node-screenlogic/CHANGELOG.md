## v1.6.1 - 2020-11-23

### Added

* Every call now can optionally specify an ID that will be returned with the result, allowing tracking of simultaneous commands.

## v1.6.0 - 2020-07-14

### Added

* Fleshed out the still-undocumented `SLEquipmentConfigurationMessage` with a few more helper methods for interpreting the data inside.
* Helper method for getting a circuit from its device ID on an `SLControllerConfigMessage`.
* Support for getting the status of pumps and setting flow speeds per-pump-per-circuit.
* Constants for interpreting heat command/mode properties on various messages:
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_OFF
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_SOLAR
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_SOLARPREFERRED
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_HEATPUMP
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_DONTCHANGE
* Debug logs using the "debug" NPM package. You'll need to run an `npm install` after updating to this version.
* Ability to cancel delays in pool equipment. #20 - thanks @bshep
* Ability to register for push messages from the equipment so the connection can be kept open instead of repeatedly reconnecting and polling for changes. See the `addClient()` and `removeClient()` functions on the `UnitConnection` docs. Thanks @bshep

## v1.5.0 - 2020-06-06

### Added

* Added support for adding, deleting, listing, and updating scheduled events - thanks @bshep
* Added egg timer support - thanks @bshep

## v1.4.0 - 2020-05-25

### Added

* Support for controlling the salt cell generator's output levels.
* Helper methods for interpreting `controllerType`.
* Experimental support for an Equipment Configuration message (not documented as of yet - `SLEquipmentConfigurationMessage` / `getEquipmentConfiguration()`). This message returns arrays of various information about the equipment, but I don't know how to interpret the information in those arrays yet. Any assistance with decoding this information would be hugely helpful.
* `error` handler on all objects for reacting to unhandled node errors - thanks @schemers

### Fixed

* VSCode "Example" configuration can now be launched on non-Windows platforms.

### Changed

* Minor memory/performance optimizations.
* Running tests no longer changes any state of any pool equipment.

## v1.3.1 - 2019-12-27

### Added

* Several methods added to SLControllerConfigMessage for interpreting the equipFlags value.

### Fixed
