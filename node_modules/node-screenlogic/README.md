# node-screenlogic

This is a Node.JS library for interfacing with Pentair ScreenLogic systems over your local network or remotely through the Pentair dispatcher. Local connections require a Pentair ScreenLogic device on the same network (a network which supports UDP broadcasts).

Tested with a Pentair ScreenLogic system on firmware versions 5.2 Build 736.0 Rel, 5.2 Build 738.0 Rel

## Usage

See example.js for an example of interfacing with the library. Broadly, import the library with

```javascript
const ScreenLogic = require('node-screenlogic');
```

then for local connections create a new ScreenLogic unit finder with

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
```

Hook its `serverFound` event with

```javascript
.on('serverFound', function(server) { })
```

and call it via `search()`. This performs a UDP broadcast on 255.255.255.255, port 1444, so ensure your network supports UDP broadcasts and the device is on the same subnet.

Alternatively, to find a unit remotely, create a new ScreenLogic remote login with

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin('Pentair: xx-xx-xx')
```

Hook its `gatewayFound` event with

```javascript
.on('gatewayFound', function(unit) { })
```

and call it via `connect()`. This opens a TCP connection to screenlogicserver.pentair.com, port 500.

When a local or remote server is found, create a new UnitConnection with

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(server);
```

or

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(unit.port, unit.ipAddr, '1234')
```

where `'1234'` is the remote login password.

Once you've connected with `connect()`, there are a number of methods available and corresponding events for when they've completed successfully. See [UnitConnection](#unitconnection) API reference.

All communication with a ScreenLogic unit is done via TCP, so responses will come back in the order they were requested.

## Notes

Contributions welcome. There are lots of available messages supported by ScreenLogic that the app doesn't support yet, but can be added pretty easily as needed.

## Packet format

All ScreenLogic packets are sent with an 8-byte header. The first 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded sender ID (which is normally specified when making the original request). The second 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded message ID. The final 4 bytes are a little-endian-encoded length of the data payload on the packet. The data payload is handled per-message.

## API Reference

Pull requests to document undocumented properties are most welcome.

### FindUnits

#### constructor()

Examples:

```javascript
const ScreenLogic = require('node-screenlogic');

var finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();

#### Events

* `serverFound` - Indicates that a ScreenLogic unit has been found. Event handler receives a [`UnitConnection`](#unitconnection) object.

Examples:

```javascript
finder.on('serverFound', function(server) {
  var client = new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(server);
})
```

* `error` - Indicates that an unhandled error was caught (such as the connection timing out)

### RemoteLogin

#### constructor(systemName)

Argument is the name of a system to connect to in "Pentair: xx-xx-xx" format.

Example:

```javascript

var remoteLogin = new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin('Pentair: xx-xx-xx');
```

#### connect()

Connects to the dispatcher service and searches for the unit passed to its constructor.

#### close()

  }
});
```

#### constructor(port, address, password)

Port is an integer. Address is an IPv4 address of the server as a string. Password is optional; should be the 4-digit password in string form, e.g. `'1234'`.

### SLGetGatewayDataMessage

Passed as an argument to the emitted `gatewayFound` event. Contains information about the remote unit's status and access properties.

#### Properties

* `gatewayFound` - boolean indicating whether a unit was found
* `licenseOK` - boolean indicating if the license is valid (I've never seen this be false)
* `ipAddr` - string containing the ipv4 address to remotely connect to this unit
* `port` - number containing the port to connect to the unit
* `portOpen` - boolean indicating whether or not the port is open and able to be connected to
* `relayOn` - boolean indicating whether the relay is on (unsure what exactly this indicates; it's always been false in my tests)

### SLAddNewScheduleEvent

Passed as an argument to the emitted `addNewScheduleEvent` event. Adds a new event to the specified schedule type, either 0 for regular events or 1 for one-time events.

#### Properties

* `scheduleType` - 0 indicates regular scheduled events, 1 indicates a run-once event

### SLDeleteScheduleEventById

Passed as an argument to the emitted `deleteScheduleEventById` event. Deletes a scheduled event with specified id.

#### Properties

* `scheduleId` - the scheduleId of the schedule to be deleted

### SLGetScheduleData

Passed as an argument to the emitted `getScheduleData` event. Retrieves a list of schedule events of the specified type, either 0 for regular events or 1 for one-time events.

#### Properties

* `scheduleType` - 0 indicates regular scheduled events, 1 indicates a run-once event

### SLSetScheduleEventById

Passed as an argument to the emitted `setScheduleEventById` event. Configures an event with properties as described below.

#### Properties

* `scheduleId` - id of a schedule previously created, see [`SLAddNewScheduleEvent`](#sladdnewscheduleevent)
* `circuitId` - id of the circuit to which this event applies
* `startTime` - the start time of the event, specified as minutes since midnight
  * example: 6:00am would be 360
  * example: 6:15am would be 375
* `stopTime` - the stop time of the event, specified as minutes since midnight
* `dayMask`
  * 7-bit mask that determines which days the schedule is active for, MSB is always 0, valid numbers 1-127
* `flags`
  * bit 0 is the schedule type, if 0 then regular event, if 1 its a run-once
  * bit 1 indicates whether heat setPoint should be changed
* `heatCmd` - integer indicating the desired heater mode. Valid values are:
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_OFF
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_SOLAR
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_SOLARPREFERRED
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_HEATPUMP
  * ScreenLogic.HEAT_MODE_DONTCHANGE
* `heatSetPoint` - the temperature set point if heat is to be changed (ignored if bit 1 of flags is 0)

### SLSetCircuitRuntimeById

Passed as an argument to the emitted `setCircuitRuntimebyId` event. Configures default run-time of a circuit, usually referred to as the 'egg timer'. This also applies to 'run-once' programs as this will set the length of the program.

#### Properties

* `circuitId` - id of the circuit to which this event applies to
* `runTime` - integer specifying the run time in minutes

### SLGetPumpStatus

Passed as an argument to the emitted `getPumpStatus` event. Gets information about the specified pump.

#### Properties

* `pumpId` - id of pump to get information about, first pump is 0

#### Return Values

* `isRunning` - boolean that says if pump is running
* `pumpType` - 0 if invalid pump id or one of the IntelliFlo constants:
  * ScreenLogic.PUMP_TYPE_INTELLIFLOVF
  * ScreenLogic.PUMP_TYPE_INTELLIFLOVS
  * ScreenLogic.PUMP_TYPE_INTELLIFLOVSF
* `pumpWatts` - current Watts usage of the pump
* `pumpRPMs` - current RPMs of the pump
* `pumpGPMs` - current GPMs of the pump
* `pumpSetting` - Array of 8 items each containing
  * `circuitId` - Circuit Id (CircuitId matched data returned by [`SLControllerConfigMessage`](#slcontrollerconfigmessage)'s `getCircuitByDeviceId()`)
  * `pumpSetPoint` - the set point for this pump/circuit combo (in either RPMs or GPMs depending on the value of `isRPMs`)
  * `isRPMs` - boolean indicating if the set point is in RPMs (false means it's in GPMs)
* `pumpUnknown1` - unknown data; always 0
* `pumpUnknown2` - unknown data; always 255

### SLSetPumpFlow

Passed as an argument to the emitted `setPumpFlow` event. Sets flow setting for a pump/circuit combination.

#### Properties

* `pumpId` - id of pump to get information about, first pump is 0
* `circuitId` - index of circuit for which to change the set point (index is relative to data returned by [`SLGetPumpStatus`](#slgetpumpstatus))
* `setPoint` - the value for which to set the pump/circuit combo
* `isRPMs` - boolean, `true` for RPMs, `false` for GPMs

### SLCancelDelay

Passed as an argument to the emitted `cancelDelay` event.

### SLAddClient

Passed as an argument to the emitted `addClient` event.

### SLRemoveClient

Passed as an argument to the emitted `removeClient` event.
