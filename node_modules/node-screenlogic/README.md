# node-screenlogic

This is a Node.JS library for interfacing with Pentair ScreenLogic systems over your local network or remotely through the Pentair dispatcher. Local connections require a Pentair ScreenLogic device on the same network (a network which supports UDP broadcasts).

Tested on node v8.11.1, v10.15.1 with a system on firmware versions 5.2 Build 736.0 Rel, 5.2 Build 738.0 Rel

# Usage

See example.js for an example of interfacing with the library. Broadly, import the library with

```javascript
const ScreenLogic = require('node-screenlogic');
```

then for local connections create a new ScreenLogic unit finder with

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
```

Hook its `serverFound` event with

```javascript
.on('serverFound', function(server) { })
```

and call it via `search()`. This performs a UDP broadcast on 255.255.255.255, port 1444, so ensure your network supports UDP broadcasts and the device is on the same subnet.

Alternatively, to find a unit remotely, create a new ScreenLogic remote login with

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin('Pentair: xx-xx-xx')
```

Hook its `gatewayFound` event with

```javascript
.on('gatewayFound', function(unit) { })
```

and call it via `connect()`. This opens a TCP connection to screenlogicserver.pentair.com, port 500.

When a local or remote server is found, create a new UnitConnection with

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(server);
```

or

```javascript
new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(unit.port, unit.ipAddr, '1234')
```
where `'1234'` is the remote login password.

Once you've connected with `connect()`, there are a number of methods available and corresponding events for when they've completed successfully. See [UnitConnection](#unitconnection) API reference.

All communication with a ScreenLogic unit is done via TCP, so responses will come back in the order they were requested.

# Notes

Contributions welcome. There are lots of available messages supported by ScreenLogic that the app doesn't support yet, but can be added pretty easily as needed.

# Packet format

All ScreenLogic packets are sent with an 8-byte header. The first 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded sender ID (which is normally specified when making the original request). The second 2 bytes are a little-endian-encoded message ID. The final 4 bytes are a little-endian-encoded length of the data payload on the packet. The data payload is handled per-message.

# API Reference

Pull requests to document undocumented properties are most welcome.

## FindUnits

### constructor()

Examples:
```javascript
const ScreenLogic = require('node-screenlogic');

var finder = new ScreenLogic.FindUnits();
```

### search()

Begins a UDP broadcast search for available units.

### close()

Closes the socket.

### Events

* `serverFound` - Indicates that a ScreenLogic unit has been found. Event handler receives a [`UnitConnection`](#unitconnection) object.

Examples:
```javascript
finder.on('serverFound', function(server) {
  var client = new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(server);
})
```

## RemoteLogin

### constructor(systemName)

Argument is the name of a system to connect to in "Pentair: xx-xx-xx" format.

Example:
```javascript
const ScreenLogic = require('./index');

var remoteLogin = new ScreenLogic.RemoteLogin('Pentair: xx-xx-xx');
```

### connect()

Connects to the dispatcher service and searches for the unit passed to its constructor.

### close()

Closes the connection

### Events

* `gatewayFound` - Indicates that the search for the named unit has completed (may or may not be successful). Event handler receives a [`SLGetGatewayDataMessage`](#slgetgatewaydatamessage) argument.

## UnitConnection

### constructor(server)

Argument is a server returned from [`FindUnits`](#findunits) `serverFound` event.

Examples:
```javascript
finder.on('serverFound', function(server) {
  var client = new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(server);
})
```

```javascript
remoteLogin.on('gatewayFound', function(unit) {
  if (unit && unit.gatewayFound) {
    var client = new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(unit.port, unit.ipAddr, '1234'));
  }
});
```

### constructor(port, address, password)

Port is an integer. Address is an IPv4 address of the server as a string. Password is optional; should be the 4-digit password in string form, e.g. `'1234'`.

Examples:
```javascript
var client = new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(80, '10.0.0.85', '1234')
```

### connect()

Connects to the server passed to its constructor.

Examples:
```javascript
var client = new ScreenLogic.UnitConnection(server);
client.connect();
```

### close()

Closes the connection.

### getVersion()

Requests the system version string from the connected unit. Emits the `version` event when the response comes back.

### getPoolStatus()

Requests pool status from the connected unit. Emits the `poolStatus` event when the response comes back.

### getChemicalData()

Requests chemical data from the connected unit (may require an IntelliChem or similar). Emits the `chemicalData` event when the response comes back.

### getSaltCellConfig()

Requests salt cell status/configuration from the connected unit (requires an IntelliChlor or compatible salt cell). Emits the `saltCellConfig` event when the response comes back.

### getControllerConfig()

Requests controller configuration from the connected unit. Emits the `controllerConfig` event when the response comes back.

### setCircuitState(controllerId, circuitId, circuitState)

Activates or deactivates a circuit. See [`SLSetCircuitStateMessage`](#slsetcircuitstatemessage) documentation for argument values. Emits the `circuitStateChanged` event when response is acknowledged.

### setSetPoint(controllerId, bodyType, temperature)

Sets the heating setpoint for any body. See [`SLSetHeatSetPointMessage`](#slsetheatsetpointmessage) documentation for argument values. Emits the `setPointChanged` event when response is acknowledged.

### setHeatMode(controllerId, bodyType, heatMode)

Sets the preferred heat mode. See [`SLSetHeatModeMessage`](#slsetheatmodemessage) documentation for argument values. Emits the `heatModeChanged` event when response is acknowledged.

### sendLightCommand(controllerId, command)

Sends a lighting command. See [`SLLightControlMessage`](#sllightcontrolmessage) documentation for argument values. Emits the `sentLightCommand` event when response is acknowledged.

Note that better/more complete handling of lighting is desired, but I have yet to find all the commands I need to implement to make that happen. This currently sends each command to all lights and there is no ability to send to an individual light. Pull requests adding more functionality here would be most welcome.

### setSaltCellOutput(controllerId, poolOutput, spaOutput)

Sets the salt cell's output levels. See [`SLSetSaltCellConfigMessage`](#slsetsaltcellconfigmessage) documentation for argument values. Emits the `setSaltCellConfig` event when response is acknowledged.
